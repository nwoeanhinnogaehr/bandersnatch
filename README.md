# bandersnatch
annotated disassembly of ZX Spectrum code from black mirror: bandersnatch. hastily disassembled in pursuit of a mostly nonexistent ARG.

requires z80asm to assemble. recommended emulator: fuse

just do `./run.sh`

All credits for the original code go to [Matt Westcott aka gasman](https://github.com/gasman). Thanks to the Black Mirror team for including cool stuff like this in the show!
